Secret Santa Bot
Algorithm:
    Host gives a time frame for people to enter <!host [time frame]>
    People type !enter. <!enter>
    After time frame. Randomly assign partners. Make sure no repeats.
    DM each person their partner.

Read through docs and watch some tutorials on JS and jsons. APIS
Figure out how to host on the cloud

## Fluff

    Countdown before time to enter expires
